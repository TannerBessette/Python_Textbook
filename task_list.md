## Task List

## December 5

1. Wrap up the knn analysis in Python.

2. Revise write-up based on comments.

3. Start incorporating that analysis into the write-up.


## November 21

1. Visualize NBA data in R.

2. Start the knn analysis in Python (scaling predictors, splitting into training/test or k-fold cross-validation, make the classification table and get classification rate).

3. MH: Read write up.

## November 14

1. Wrangle basketball data (getting everything in R done before the knn analysis.

2. Wrapping up the write up (proportion graphs, adding some text in the python analysis, etc.).

3. Review knn (MH: Send Tanner something).

4. MH: Look at this quarto rendering issue.

## November 7

1. MH: Look at heatmaps (both size and whether or not they match the R heatmaps).

2. Expand on the write-up (adding more R/Python function comparisons. pivots, join/merge, n()/.size, summarise(), how python treats "factor")

3. Put the write-up into a .qmd file.

4. In the write-up, integrate the R and Python analyses. When comparing, pick out a few line-by-line examples that show R analysis and Python analysis (using eval: false if you don't want them to actually run).

5. See handwritten sheet for structure of write-up.

6. MH and Tanner: Both think of a couple of stat learning / machine learning data sets.



## October 31

1. Finish the Python analysis.

2. Thinking about data for the second analysis.

3. If time, start writing a summary of your first project, including results, including differences/similarities between R and python.

## October 24

"Half week"

1. Make other heatmps with proportion of medals won in each sport.

2. Adjust the colours on the bar plots to be consistent and lighter for athletes, darker for medals.

"Full week"

3. Get started with Python for Olympic analysis

## For October 10

1. Move analysis to Positron (in own folder).

2. Heatmap adjustments:

    * collapse some of the sports 
    * order the country factor by most to least medals won.

3. Put into a short write-up, introducing the data, interpreting the plots, etc.

4. Adjust athlete plot to have either number of athletes or number of medal changes on y-axis, country on x-axis, and fill by number of medals won.

## For October 3

1. Continue making exploratory plots of medals in countries and number of athletes in countries (think about how you would visualize number of athletes on a "team").

2. Explore differences in the number of athletes from each sex that countries (1) send to the olympics and (2) win medals.

3. Make heatmap of sport on x-axis, country on y-axis, and filled by number of athletes or by number of medals.


## For September 26

1. Do Chapter on data import.

2. Come up with a question of interest (or more than one question) for the olympics data set.

3. Maybe start to explore one or more of the olympics data sets in r.

4. Get yourself pumped up for the possibility of Q-Club!!

## For September 19

1. Do Chapter 4.6, 5, and 6.

2. Start thinking about questions of interest for the olympic data set (if you decide to use that).

   
   
## For September 12

1. Do Chapter 3 and 4.1 - 4.5 of <https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/data-visualise.html>.

2. Think about possible data sets to use for the 2 projects.
3. 
## For September 5

1. Do Chapter 2 of <https://aeturrell.github.io/python4DS/data-visualise.html>.

2. Maybe short intro to Python video.

3. Familiarize yourself with Positron IDE.
