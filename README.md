# Statistics Honors Senior Year Experience

This GitHub project encapsulates my senior year experience course at St. Lawrence University, which I completed with guidance from Professor Matt Higham to earn an honors distinction in my Statistics major. Prior to this project, I had experience in data science using R, and I completed this project to teach myself similar skills in Python and compare the two languages. The work included studying Python through selected chapters of a data science textbook and completing two main projects: manipulating and visualizing data from the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, and building a k-nearest-neighbors model to predict NBA All-Star selections.

The write-up for my semester project is available in the Olympics_Write_Up.html file. This includes the results of my analyses on the Olympics and NBA All-Star projects, a comparison of R and Python function equivalents that I discovered during the project, and my personal reflections comparing the two coding languages.
